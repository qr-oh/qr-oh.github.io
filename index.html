<h1 id="welcome">Welcome!</h1>

<p class="home">I am Qi Ren, currently a year 3 <b>Electrical Engineering</b> student in the National University of Singapore. I love technology and how it has transformed the way we live. Hence, I am studying to learn about the various technologies. With this knowledge, I hope to be capable of designing products that automate/bring convenience to our lives.</p>

<p class="home">In my third and final years, I intend to pursue the understanding of <b>5G</b> and <b>Internet of Things (IoT)</b> in greater depth. In my free time, I like to explore what one can do with <b>Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)</b>.</p>

<p class="home">In this site, I will be featuring projects that I have worked on, my hobbies, as well as the skills and experience that I have acquired along the way. Thanks for dropping by!</p>
